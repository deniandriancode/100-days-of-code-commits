# Day 1 Log  

I have used terminal for quite sometime, but I haven't use the `dig` command.
When first using it, I'm confused because I don't know anything about DNS except 
that it is some kind 'Internet Phonebook', from there I learn a lot about DNS 
and even managed to setup my computer to connected to Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 resolver.
